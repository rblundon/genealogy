Publish in a newspaper Born February 16th, 1941. Passed away unexpectedly while mowing grass on May 11th, 2025, awaiting a Mother's Day Celebration in Heaven. Survived by Rosemary Dompke, his constant companion, caregiver and \"love of his life\" for the past 50 years. Joe was always active helping friends where he could prior to the past three years when the wind was taken out of his sails due to health problems. His leisure time, if there ever was any, was spent traveling with Rosemary. They enjoyed traveling the US, Canada and Mexico and wore out several cars, station wagons and an RV. Many good memories were made no matter where they went. He was always inquisitive since childhood as to how something was made or worked. He maintained our cars and homes until his health was failing; this weighed heavily on him. He loved anything carved out of wood and he had several hand carved pieces. He loved to pull pranks on friends, had a talent for storytelling and just loved talking up a storm, always with a distinct laugh and beautiful smile. He will be missed by many long-time loyal friends. Joe was a 28-year employee of Pabst Brewing Company. Joe was preceded in death by his parents Max and Violet (nee Nowakowski), his brother Reginald (Donna), his sister Maxine (Terry) Kaczmarowski and niece Patricia \"Patsy\" Blundon. He is survived by a nephew Reg Paradowski, Jr. and his family, and a niece Cindy (Michael) Hennen and their family. Also survived by great niece Megan (Ross) Wurz and son Finley and great nephew Ryan (Amy) Blunden and family, and their father Steve (Darlene) Blundon. Further survived by many cousins and a multitude of faithful lifelong friends. A special thank you to the neighbors who found Joe and called 911, the fire department response team and staff of Aurora St. Lukes Emergency Dept. Shout out to our neighbors Ramon and Carmen who always seem to be there when we need them. Love you two! Much gratitude to Joe's doctors, Dr. Lingam Kumar (a great friend) and Dr. V.K. Rao. You will be missed Joe! Rest in peace my love. You are without pain now. As Joe would say, save your money on flowers, instead donate to one of Joe's numerous charities that touched his heart, it will do more good! American Cancer Society , Alzheimer's Association , American Heart Association , Feeding America, Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital , Shriners Children's Hospital , Tunnel to Towers Foundation or Habitat for Humanity . Please designate donations \"In Memory Of Joseph G. Paradowski\", he'll love you for it! Visitation will be held at the funeral home on Wednesday, May 21st, 2025 from 4-7 PM. Entombment on Thursday, May 22nd, 2025 at 11 AM at St. Adalbert Cemetery, 3801 S. 6th St., Milwaukee. (Please meet at the cemetery). To plant trees in memory, please visit the Sympathy Store .

American Heart Association May 16, 2025 May your memories of the wonderful times you shared with your loved one comfort you and your family, today and always. Bobby Yunker May 15, 2025 Where to start? Joe had a persona that would fill a room. A sense of humor that would leave you teary eyed and sore from laughter. A man who was inquisitive and curious about everything . He was always learning,and a wealth of knowledge. Joe was the first to stand up and help someone, the sort of guy who would help a stranger change a flat tire, in the rain. He had an inherent sense of duty, and an unerring sense of decency. A man with endless love for his family and Rosemary. A heart as big as Texas. I am proud to have called him friend. Joe was truly one of a kind.
